            <h5>ABOUT ME</h5>
            <h2>As mentioned, a passionate and hard-working individual</h2>
            <p>My name is Ahmed Spahiƒá and I am a high school graduate from the First gymnasium in Zenica. As an individual looking forward to learn and gain more experience in IT sector, I looked for many ways to get more knowledge and to show-off myself and my skills. Since my goal is to be fully suitable for a position in a IT company, but also for a continious progress at work, I can be seen in many sections of this sector such as web design, algorithms, computer science, UI/UX design and so on.</p>
            <p>During all of my four years of high school studies, I developed my interest in practical work in the IT sector. My desire for practical knowledge led me to the CSS 2023 competition, where I learned not only about the web development, but also about several Firm's such as AtlantBH while consultating with other, already employed, coleagues.</p>
            <p>Many positions in this sectors are challenging. However, I look forward to them.  Even if there is someone who is way more experienced than me, I will work hard and try my best to be worthy of that position, because I don't only care about me and my own future, but also about my future Firm's way to become more and more prestigious and well-known, in addition to helping my job coleagues and developing positive and healthy relationships.</p>

          <h2>There are currently {Projects} repositories signed as<br /><i>#project</i></h2>
          <p>As an individual who is always seeking new challenges and opportunities, I find myself constantly intrigued by innovative projects. The thrill of diving into uncharted territory and pushing the boundaries of what is possible truly captivates my spirit. I am driven by a relentless desire to grow both personally and professionally, and I believe that engaging in exciting new ventures is the key to unlocking my full potential.</p>
          <p>While I take immense pride in my accomplishments, I also recognize the value of teamwork and collaboration. I believe that great projects are the result of a collective effort, where each individual brings their unique strengths to the table. I actively seek opportunities to engage with like-minded professionals, fostering an environment of open communication and shared aspirations. Together, we can achieve remarkable things.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, my unwavering enthusiasm for new projects, coupled with my strong work ethic and commitment to excellence, positions me as an ideal candidate for any undertaking. I am ready to embrace the unknown, break new ground, and demonstrate the depth of my capabilities. Together, let us embark on a journey of innovation, leaving a lasting legacy in the projects we undertake.</p>
